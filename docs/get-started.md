# Hey, welcome to Chipper :wave:

**Awesome to have you here!** You might be wondering, "Who or what is Chipper?" Let me give you a quick introduction.
Chipper started as a set of Python scripts designed to experiment with local RAGs (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Essentially, we process local text files and enhance an AI model with that data.

The big advantage? By using RAG or embedding our knowledge base, we can achieve impressive results with much smaller models and keep everything private on your computer.

  <summary>I want to know more! ðŸ’¡</summary>

With our embedded knowledge base, we essentially give our local Ollama model a "notebook" to reference. So, when we ask it something like, "Who is the best golden retriever in the universe?" it quickly checks a database, ElasticSearch in our case, to see if it has any relevant information. The database then returns embeddings to augment the model's response, making the process super fast and awesome!

Chipper essentially provides an end-to-end architecture for experimenting with embeddings right from your command line. It leverages many awesome open-source tools like [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) to manage embeddings and queries, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to eliminate system dependencies and make setup a breeze, and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to simplify visual changes. Plus, it includes many other small but powerful tools to make your exploration effortless and enjoyable. Mostly written in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

**There is way more to learn about RAGs**

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation is a good start.

## Step 1 - Basic Setup

::: info
Everything mentioned here assumes some familiarity with the command line on your system. If youâ€™re using Windows, consider using [MSYS](https://www.msys2.org/) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) to make things easier.
:::

### 1.1 - Docker

Alright, letâ€™s get you set up! Thereâ€™s one key requirement: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Chipper uses Docker to simplify the process and eliminate the need for a complex local setup on your machine.

- [If you're new to Docker, this will get you started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

### 1.2 - Git

Secondly, youâ€™ll need Git, a version control tool thatâ€™s also the inspiration behind GitHubâ€™s name. If you donâ€™t already have Git installed, no worries:

- [This guide will help you get started](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git)

## Step 2 - Project Setup

### 2.1 - Clone

To get the latest version of Chipper on your system, youâ€™ll need to clone it locally. Simply run the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:TilmanGriesel/chipper.git
```

### 2.2 - Start Chipper

Now weâ€™re getting somewhere! Chipper uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to orchestrate the various components we need to work together, such as ElasticSearch and Chipper services. The best part? You donâ€™t have to do much to get started, Chipper comes with a default configuration ready for experimentation.

#### 2.2.1 - Navigate to your cloned Chipper directory

```bash
cd chipper
```

#### 2.2.2 - Run the setup script

```bash
./run.sh up
```

> This step may take some time as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) downloads all the required resources and compiles Chipper on your system.

## Step 3 - Let's Test

Letâ€™s verify that everything is working as expected by importing some test data included with Chipper. During this process, weâ€™ll also pull the embedding model from Ollama if it hasnâ€™t been downloaded yet.

### 3.1.1 - Embed Testdata

```bash
./run.sh embed-testdata
```

### 3.1.2 - Web Interface

```bash
./run.sh browser
```

or open: `http://localhost:21200`

### 3.1.3 - Send Test-Query

```plain
Tell me a story about Chipper, the brilliant golden retriever.
```

Chipper will now respond using the test data embeddings we set up in the previous step. Essentially, we embedded a few fun stories about Chipperâ€™s adventures, so youâ€™ll likely hear all about them now!

::: info
Youâ€™ll likely see a message like `Starting to download model xy.z...`. Donâ€™t worry, this only happens once for the default model. In the future, I plan to enhance this process with a progress bar or something similar. Once the download is complete, you can reload the page for a smoother experience.

## Step 4 - Embed your own data

Congratulations! Now weâ€™re diving into the details. Embeddings are organized into whatâ€™s called an `index`, which is essentially a label for a "drawer" where data or embeddings are stored. By default, Chipper uses an index named `default`. While embeddings and the web UI will automatically use this default, you can specify a different one if needed. Just remember, if you switch to another index, youâ€™ll also need to select it in the web UI using the `/index myindex` command.

### 4.1 - Basic Embedding

```bash
./run.sh embed /my/data/path
```

We can only embed text data, by default Chipper accepts:

> `.txt`, `.md`, `.py`, `.html`, `.js`, `.cpp`, `.hpp`, `.xml` extensions.
> You can change this whitelist by passing your own `--extensions` list.

### 4.1 - Advanced Embedding

Now weâ€™re ready to experiment! You can explore different splitting configurations to customize how text documents are divided. For example, you can use the `--split-by` argument to specify the method of splittingâ€”options include "word," "sentence," "passage," "page," or "line." Adjust the `--split-length` to define the number of units per split, `--split-overlap` to set the number of units overlapping between splits, or `--split-threshold` to fine-tune the process further.

For more details about the available options and how they work, check out the [Haystack DocumentSplitter documentation](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/documentsplitter).

You can set the index using the `--es-index <name>` parameter, specify the embedding model with `--embedding-model <name>`, and much more. For a complete list of options and possibilities, refer to the help command:

```bash
./tools/embed/run.sh --help
```

## Step 5 - Where to go from here?

First off, if youâ€™ve made it this far, let me unravel the mystery behind why Chipper is called Chipper the Golden Retriever. For starters, I adore golden retrievers! But thereâ€™s more to it: they love to "chip" wood, just like we need to split and chip the data we want to embed. And as for "retriever", - well ...

Jokes aside, this project offers plenty more tools to explore. You can transcribe audio files into text and embed it, scrape websites (only your own or with proper consent), or dive into the frontend, here you can write `/help` to see some options or backend to customize and change Chipper to suit your needs.

While I plan to expand this documentation, I generally prefer to keep things documented directly in the code and configuration files. I hope you have a fantastic time experimenting! You will find many `./run.sh` scripts, the root one will give you some points to start if you invoke it without arguments.

If you enjoy what you see, [leaving a star on the GitHub repo](https://github.com/TilmanGriesel/chipper) would mean the world to me.

Have a nice day!
