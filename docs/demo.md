# Chipper in Action ðŸŽ¬

Experience Chipper live right here! Please note that the demo's functionality is subject to limitations. It utilizes the **Hugging Face serverless inference API**, which operates under strict quotas and rate limits. Each user is allowed up to **8 prompts per day**. The embedded documents are the chipper test data.

**Maybe you ask Chipper now:**
```plain
Tell me a story about Chipper, the brilliant golden retriever.
```

This demo **is limited by the free resources** available from Hugging Face and myself. The quality of the results depends on the specific model and its size, with larger models typically producing more accurate outcomes. Please note that model and index selection options are disabled in this demo.

Additionally, the serverless inference API may sometimes queue your request, leading to delays. During this period, youâ€™ll see the "**Chipper is thinking...**" message. Keep in mind that the performance of Hugging Face inference in this demo may vary and does **not represent the experience of a self-hosted setup**.

### Experimentation ðŸ§ª
Since Chipper uses embeddings, you can ask him about his adventures based on the [embedded stories](https://github.com/TilmanGriesel/chipper/tree/main/tools/embed/testdata/md/internal).

### Models Used
- **Inference**: [meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct)
- **Embedding**: [sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2)
